# stonks
## Project is dead

## Story
I started earning some extra money by repairing smartphones.
Most phones are so broken, that I cannot make any profit out of repairing them, so I tried to make an app, that will show me potential offers without spending many hours on looking for them myself.
I started by looking for price differences between OLX and Allegro for every used device, from smartphones to printers, even it wasn't broken.
It does somewhat work, but most (if not every) stonkses are false positives.
Algorithm that looks for stonkses needs a ton of filters for example: iPhone 8 case is interpreted as iPhone 8, which means that a false stonks will be created with hundreds of money to earn.
Saddly, it requires too much work for me to finish it and Allegro turned off the most important API route for approved apps.
So, I open sourced it.
