# Device recognizer
Named Entity Recognizer that can extract device model, color, ram and rom capacity from text.  
Offers often have unnecessary words in title, which prevents the search engine from working properly.
Thanks to device-recognier, I can extract the device model and successfully use it to search for profits.
