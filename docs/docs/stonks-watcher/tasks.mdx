# Tasks

Every stonks-watcher task is explained here.

## update_device_prices()

Downloads list of devices from API and checks price for each device on Allegro.
Unfortunately, Allegro has a **limit of 6 requests per minute** to their /listing route,
which means I cannot check price of more than 6 devices per minute.
Thus, this task will be run every minute, changing default value in config is highly unrecommended,
unless Allegro changes their limits.
